Combating Deepfakes

Generative AI technologies are extremely helpful in synthesising realistic life-like video, image or audio. We use generative models to synthesizing engaging videos in multiple languages. But these technologies are sometimes misused by malicious agents to create manipulative fake videos, popularly known as "deepfakes", that could be harmful for the society. 

In order to combat Deepfakes videos we join hands with the AI research community in creating technologies to detect Deepfakes. We have created around 7GB (Approximately 7 hours) of Deepfakes dataset open-sourced for research use. We update the database on usual basis.
